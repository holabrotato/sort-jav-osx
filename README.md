## Introduction
The sort_jav Python script sorts a folder of unsorted jav videos. The script was written by
[/u/Ohura](https://reddit.com/user/Ohura). The goal is help users sort all their jav content nice and easily.

What it does is it takes a folder full of unsorted jav videos tagged with the video ID and sorts
them, changing the name, puts them in their own folder, and grabbing the cover image. There
are a few settings you can configure, for example, you can opt out of putting them in folders or
getting covers.

## Change Notes
### v1.2
- Fixed an issue where the program wouldn’t stop early during a problematic file
- Fixed an issue due to Cloudflare being added to javlibrary. This requires significantly
more setup from you, sorry about that but it was necessary.
- Fixed some issues where certain filenames didn’t sort properly because the name had
other portions that looked like IDs
### v1.1
- Fixed an issue where the program failed to work after javlibrary changed their HTML
structure for pages.
- Videos no longer have to be named correctly. The sorter can now determine what the ID
of the video is even if it has nonsense in the name. This may not work for every single
name, so please message me if you find ones that fail.

## Prerequisites
You must have Python 3.5 or higher installed in order for this to work. If you do not have it or are
unsure, you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . This will likely no work
on Python 2.x, and has not been tested on it.

Due to javlibrary adding Cloudflare, you are now required to have cfscrape installed. You can
view how to install it here: https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape#installation . You will
need node.js installed to run it. Please refer to their respective documentation on installation.

If you're on OSX and want to use the osx-add-tags feature, you'll need to install Tag.
https://github.com/jdberry/tag. 
Easy way to install is to use Homebrew: 
```brew install tag```

## Folder Setup
You need to set it up so all the videos you want to sort are all in a single folder, and that folder is
the path you specify in the settings. Any files in folders within that folder will be ignored, so you
can move them out of folders they may already be in.

Videos no longer need to be renamed, the sorter can now handle this. Videos with multiple files
that are not tagged correctly may fail to sort. The sorter will not remove any of these files, just
fail to sort them correctly. There are two formats that the sorter will understand for multiple
videos:

1. A letter appears directly after the end of the video ID, for example MIRD150A and
MIRD150B. It will detect them as two files for the same video and rename them
accordingly.
2. The old system method, where the video title has the multiple video suffix attached. For
example, if multiple videos are denoted by a ! symbol and the video is MIRD-150!A and
MIRD-150!B, the sorter will understand.

## How To Run

Please first edit the settings to match your desired preferences. This should be very quick and
only take a minute. It will not work if you do not do this, particularly with the folder you need to
specify.

Once the settings are good, you can double click sort_jav.py to run it. A box should pop up and
stay open while running the script, giving you details about what’s happening. It will give you
another message when it finishes, and hitting enter will close the program at that point.
Alternatively you can invoke it from the command line. A note that this requires .py files to be
associated with the Python executable file (Python.exe for most of us), if they are not and you
do not know how to fix this, please contact me.

## Settings

The settings.ini file provided with it lists a few of the options the user has available to them as
well as descriptions on those options.

For settings that say true/false, please use the values true or false to indicate. For other values,
it will use whatever appears directly after the = sign on the same line.

Please note that where it gives you options to include delimiters, certain characters are
disallowed by the OS. If you include them, they will be forcibly removed from your delimiter. For
windows, that would be: / \ : * ? < > |

## Additional Notes

Any video files that can’t be found on javlibrary will be ignored. The program will notify you of
any problems it has trying to sort them.

Occasionally the results will be incorrect, this is because javlibrary incorrectly states the id of the
video on their website. You should double check all the results appear to be correct.

Videos with the id code r18 or t28 cannot be detected with the new special method, so the
program defaults to the old method. For videos with those names, please rename them before
running the program.

If a video is renamed to something that is too long, the program will ignore moving it. This may
result in a folder being created but files not being placed in there. For reference, maximum file
lengths are around 255, so for videos with several actresses in them, it’s best not to include the
actress name in both the file and folder.
